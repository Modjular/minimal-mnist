# Minimal MNIST
A very small fully connected neural network able to classify images from the MNIST database.
The purpose of this is to eventually create a physical visualization of the neural network.

The network is to be optimized using BOHB to find the best hyperparameters. 

# Goals
The goal is to create a very small network that can classify images from MNIST.
The final network will then be implemented on a Raspberry Pi Zero W and the values of every neuron are then to be visualized using physical LEDs
