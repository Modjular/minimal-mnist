# Minimal MNIST
A very small fully connected neural network able to classify images from the MNIST database.
The purpose of this is to create a physical visualization of the neural network.
To save costs and to make it simpler to understand, the network will be 2 32-node fully connected layers and a 10-node ouput layer
